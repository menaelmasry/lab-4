//The pulse rate will be inputed by the user of physician
//Also the function will ask the user if the patient is athlete
// The pulse rate will be a value of beats per min (beats/min)
//The function will check the value
//If the pulse rate value ( int rate) is between 60 to 100 beats/min
//An output display function will announce that the pulse rate is normal(string pulseresult)
//If the pulse rate is higher than 100
//An output display function will announce that the pulse rate is higher than normal
//If the pulse rate is lower than 60
//An output display function will announce that the pulse rate is lower than normal
// The function will check if the patient is an athlete
// If the patient is an athlete and their blood pressure is between 40 to 60 beats per min
// An output display function will announce that the pulse rate is normal
//With each output depending on the output the patient's information will also be displayed
//The information includes name, date, time, id number, and comments of the user or physician concerning the patient's pulse rate level
